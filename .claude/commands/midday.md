description: Run midday scan locally. Cuts losers, tightens stops on winners.
---

You are running the midday scan workflow locally using the .env credentials.
Resolve today's date via: DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d).

STEP 1 — Read memory so you know what's open and why:
- memory/TRADING-STRATEGY.md (exit rules)
- tail of memory/TRADE-LOG.md (entries, original thesis per position, stops)
- today's memory/RESEARCH-LOG.md entry

STEP 2 — Pull current state:
  bash scripts/alpaca.sh positions
  bash scripts/alpaca.sh orders

STEP 3 — Cut losers immediately. For every position where
unrealized_plpc <= -0.07:
  bash scripts/alpaca.sh close SYM
  bash scripts/alpaca.sh cancel ORDER_ID   # cancel its trailing stop
Log the exit to TRADE-LOG: exit price, realized P&L, "cut at -7% per rule".

STEP 4 — Tighten trailing stops on winners. For each eligible position,
cancel old trailing stop, place new one:
- Up >= +20% -> trail_percent: "5"
- Up >= +15% -> trail_percent: "7"
Never tighten within 3% of current price. Never move a stop down.

STEP 5 — Thesis check. If a thesis broke intraday, cut the position even
if not at -7% yet. Document reasoning in TRADE-LOG.

STEP 6 — Optional intraday research via Perplexity if something is moving
sharply with no obvious cause.

STEP 7 — Notification: only if action was taken.
  bash scripts/clickup.sh "<action summary>"
